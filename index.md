## Who are we?

We provide elegant solutions to industries hardest questions. Utilzing quantum computing, ML, and optimization we can enchance any industry with a costumer centric approach. 

Our algorithms are open source so anyone can play with them, always looking to collaborate with anyone who has passion to code.

### Our Solutions

Currently we are building solutions for fintech, biotech, atmospheric science, and computer security.

In the past we have developed open source algorithms for qsharp, scipy, and REALOP.

Stimulated by the hardest questions and driven to give back to our community.
