## Who are we? 
Delivering the quantum advantage with creativity, technicality, and ease of use!    

We provide elegant solutions to industries hardest problems. Utilzing quantum computing, ML, and optimization we can enchance any industry with a customer centric approach. 

Our algorithms are open source so anyone can play with them, always looking to collaborate with anyone who has passion to code.

### Our Solutions   

In the past we have developed open source algorithms for qsharp, scipy, and REALOP.

Stimulated by the hardest questions and driven to give back to our community.
